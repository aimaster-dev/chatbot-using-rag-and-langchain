# 🧠 Chatbot Using RAG and LangChain

A Streamlit-based chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and OpenAI. Upload your PDFs and chat with them! This app leverages LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI’s GPT models to extract and query document content with metadata-aware answers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aimaster-dev/chatbot-using-rag-and-langchain.git
cd chatbot-using-rag-and-langchain
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set OpenAI API Key

Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with:

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-key"
```

Or export it via environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Upload PDFs** via the UI
2. Each PDF is parsed using `PyPDF2` and chunked via LangChain’s `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
3. Chunks are embedded using OpenAI Embeddings
4. Stored in a FAISS vector store for semantic similarity search
5. Queries are matched to top PDF chunks and passed to ChatGPT with context
6. Answers include **file name** and **page number** metadata for citation
